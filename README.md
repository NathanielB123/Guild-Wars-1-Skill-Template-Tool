# Guild-Wars-1-Skill-Template-Tool
A simple console-based tool focussed around monster drafting that also allows for reading and creating Guild Wars 1 Skill Templates

Requires BeautifulSoup (pip install beautifulsoup4)

Everything should be quite self-explanatory - requires bidict to run (pip install bidict)

There is no way I would have been able to create this without the help of the incredible Guild Wars 1 wiki https://wiki.guildwars.com/.
