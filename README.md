# Guild-Wars-1-Skill-Template-Tool
A simple console-based tool for reading and creating Guild Wars 1 Skill Templates

Everything should be quite self-explanatory - requires bidict to run (pip install bidict)

There is no way I would have been able to create this without the help of the incredible Guild Wars 1 wiki https://wiki.guildwars.com/.

There are a couple more advanced GUI-based tools out there that fit the same purpose, but I personally could not find any that they were open source and/or
supported creation of builds through simply typing in skill/attribute names which is very useful for quickly copying monster builds from the wikif for 
"Monster Drafting" challenge runs.

Because of that latter use, I have also added functionality to "Draw Monster"s. This selects an NPC from a random pool using all NPCs in campaign missions listed 
on the wiki. I have currently only added NPCs for the Prophecies campaign but will add more soon.
